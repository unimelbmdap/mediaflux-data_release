!!! todo
    This is just a template. Please modify and update as needed. At the very least, remove this admonition!

You can grab the data from [our amazing high impact work](http://snarxiv.org) here:

[Download :octicons-download-16:](#){ .md-button }

This will prompt you to download the [Mediaflux Data Mover](https://wiki-rcs.unimelb.edu.au/display/RCS/Data+Mover) client (if not already installed) and will automatically open it. From here you can select the files you wish to download and the destination directory.

You can also use the Data Mover client to download directly from the terminal. Instructions can be [found here](https://wiki-rcs.unimelb.edu.au/display/RCS/Data+Mover+Command+Line+Interface).
